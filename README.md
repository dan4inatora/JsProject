# JsProject

## Core idea
   The idea is to implement a multiplayer tower defence game. The game will need 4 players in total to start. There will be two players on
   each side of the field. They will have a chat only between them, so they can develop their strategy (how to deploy attacking and 
   and defending units). The game will be turn based, meaning each side will have a certain time to deploy their current strategy and the
   goal is to destroy the opossite team's base
   
## What we need to implement
   Each player will be logging in with an user name and password and we will store data for the player such as win count, rank...etc
   there will be a chat between each player of the same fraction. We will make different models and animations of attacking and defending
   structures. Each structure and unit will have a health pool and some attack value.
